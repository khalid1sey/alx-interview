# Pascal's Triangle Function

## Function Signature
```python
def pascal_triangle(n):
```

## Description
The `pascal_triangle` function returns a list of lists of integers representing the first `n` rows of Pascal's Triangle.

### Parameters
- `n` (int): The number of rows of Pascal's Triangle to generate. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list.

### Returns
- A list of lists containing integers representing the rows of Pascal's Triangle. Each row `k` (0-indexed) contains `k + 1` elements.

### Example
```python
>>> pascal_triangle(5)
[
    [1],
    [1, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [1, 3, 3, 1],
    [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```

### Explanation
- The first row (row 0) contains a single element, `1`.
- Each subsequent row is constructed by adding the two elements above it from the previous row. 
- For example, the third row `[1, 2, 1]` is derived from adding `1 + 1` and `1 + 0` (with the assumption of `0` as a placeholder for nonexistent elements).

## Usage
To use this function, simply call it with a positive integer. If you want to visualize the triangle, you can use the provided `print_triangle` function from the `0-main.py` script.

### Example Usage
```python
from 0-pascal_triangle import pascal_triangle

triangle = pascal_triangle(5)
for row in triangle:
    print(row)
```

## Notes
- The function assumes that `n` is always an integer.
- The function is designed to efficiently generate the triangle up to the specified number of rows.
